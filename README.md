## üå± How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anmol210202/JobifyMERN.git
cd JobifyMERN
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm run setup-project
```

This command will install dependencies for both the server and the client.

### 3. Start the Development Server

To run both the client and the server locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and the client concurrently. The server will run on
[http://localhost:5100](http://localhost:5100) and the client will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### 4. Environment Variables

Make sure to create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables (or update them based on your project needs):

```bash
NODE_ENV=development   # Set to 'production' for production environment
PORT=5100              # Port for the server to run on
MONGO_URL=<your_mongo_connection_string>  # MongoDB connection URL
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>  # Secret key for JWT authentication
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d      # JWT token expiration time (e.g., '1d', '1h')
CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>  # Cloudinary cloud name
CLOUD_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>  # Cloudinary API key
CLOUD_API_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>  # Cloudinary API secret
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders (`<your_mongo_connection_string>`, `<your_jwt_secret>`, etc.) with your actual values.
